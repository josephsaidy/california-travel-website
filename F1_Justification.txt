Layout Changes Justification

No changes were made to the original layouts from Task 1.
The overall structure, navigation, and page organization stayed the same. 
I only added extra content to the city pages 
(anchor links in the Explore section and short sections for Attractions, Parks, Museums, and Food) 
and included numeric income values with simple sources (Data USA). 
These were content updates and did not affect the layout design.
