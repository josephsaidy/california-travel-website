Layout Changes Justification

No changes were made to the original layouts from Task 1. 
The overall structure, navigation, and page organization stayed the same. 
I only added extra content to the city pages 
(anchor links in the Explore section and short sections for 
Attractions, Parks, Museums, and Food) 
and updated the incorporation year for Sacramento. 

These were content changes and did not affect the layout design.
